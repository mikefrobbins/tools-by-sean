Class,Code,Description,RFC,Explanation
Informational,100,Continue,RFC 7231,The client may continue with its request. This interim response is used to inform the client that the initial part of the request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client SHOULD continue by sending the remainder of the request or if the request has already been completed ignore this response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.
Informational,101,Switching Protocols,RFC 7231,The server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request via the Upgrade message header field (section 14.41) for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server will switch protocols to those defined by the response's Upgrade header field immediately after the empty line which terminates the 101 response. The protocol should only be switched when it is advantageous to do so. For example switching to a newer version of HTTP is advantageous over older versions and switching to a real-time synchronous protocol may be advantageous when delivering resources that use such features.
Informational,102,Processing,RFC 2518 WebDAV,As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request but no response is available yet.[8] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.
Informational,103,checkpoint,,Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.
Success,200,OK,RFC 7231,Success. The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request for example: GET an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response; HEAD the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested resource are sent in the response without any message-body; POST an entity describing or containing the result of the action; TRACE an entity containing the request message as received by the end server.
Success,201,Created,RFC 7231,The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response with the most specific URL for the resource given by a Location header field. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately the server should respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.
Success,202,Accepted,RFC 7231,The request has been accepted for processing but the processing has not been completed. The request MAY or MAY NOT eventually be acted upon as it MAY be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation such as this. The 202 response is intentionally non-committal. Its purpose is to allow a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring that the user agent's connection to the server persist until the process is completed. The entity returned with this response SHOULD include an indication of the request's current status and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the user can expect the request to be fulfilled.
Success,203,Non-Authoritative Information,RFC 7231,The returned metainformation in the entity-header is not the definitive set as available from the origin server but is gathered from a local or a third-party copy. The set presented MAY be a subset or superset of the original version. For example including local annotation information about the resource MAY result in a superset of the metainformation known by the origin server. Use of this response code is not required and is only appropriate when the response would otherwise be 200 (OK).
Success,204,No Content,RFC 7231,The server has fulfilled the request but there is no new information to send back. If the client is a user agent it SHOULD NOT change its document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view. The response MAY include new metainformation in the form of entity-headers which SHOULD apply to the document currently in the user agent's active view. The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.
Success,205,Reset Content,RFC 7231,The server has fulfilled the request and the user agent SHOULD reset the document view which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place via user input followed by a clearing of the form in which the input is given so that the user can easily initiate another input action. The response MUST NOT include an entity.
Success,206,Partial Content,RFC 7233,The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource. The request must have included a Range header field (section 14.36) indicating the desired range. The response MUST include either a Content-Range header field (section 14.17) indicating the range included with this response or a multipart/byteranges Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If multipart/byteranges is not used the Content-Length header field in the response MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the message-body. A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.
Success,207,Multi-Status,RFC 4918 WebDAV,The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes depending on how many sub-requests were made.[
Success,208,Already Reported,RFC 5842 WebDAV,The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request and are not being included again.
Success,226,IM Used,RFC 3229,The server has fulfilled a request for the resource and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.
Redirect,300,Multiple Choices,RFC 7231,The requested resource corresponds to any one of a set of representations each with its own specific location and agent-driven negotiation information (section 12) is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation and redirect its request to that location. Unless it was a HEAD request the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent selection of the most appropriate choice may be performed automatically. However this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection. If the server has a preferred choice of representation it SHOULD include the specific URL for that representation in the Location field; user agents MAY use the Location field value for automatic redirection. This response is cachable unless indicated otherwise.
Redirect,301,Moved Permanently,RFC 7231,The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource SHOULD be done using one of the returned URIs. Clients with link editing capabilities SHOULD automatically re-link references to the Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned by the server where possible. This response is cachable unless indicated otherwise. If the new URI is a location its URL SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s). If the 301 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a 301 status code some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a GET request.
Redirect,302,Found - Moved Temporarily,RFC 7231,The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection may be altered on occasion the client SHOULD continue to use the Request-URI for future requests. This response is only cachable if indicated by a Cache-Control or Expires header field. If the new URI is a location its URL SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s). If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after receiving a 302 status code some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents will erroneously change it into a GET request.
Redirect,303,See Other,RFC 7231,The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method on that resource. This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the originally requested resource. The 303 response is not cachable but the response to the second (redirected) request MAY be cachable. If the new URI is a location its URL SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).
Redirect,304,Not Modified,RFC 7232,If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed but the document has not been modified the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The response MUST NOT contain a message-body. The response MUST include the following header fields: Date ETag and/or Content-Location if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request Expires Cache-Control and/or Vary if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous response for the same variant If the conditional GET used a strong cache validator (see section 13.3.3) the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-headers. Otherwise (i.e. the conditional GET used a weak validator) the response MUST NOT include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers. If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached then the cache MUST disregard the response and repeat the request without the conditional. If a cache uses a received 304 response to update a cache entry the cache MUST update the entry to reflect any new field values given in the response. The 304 response MUST NOT include a message-body
Redirect,305,Use Proxy,RFC 7231,The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field. The Location field gives the URL of the proxy. The recipient is expected to repeat the request via the proxy.
Redirect,306,Switch Proxy,RFC 2616,"No longer used. Originally meant ""Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy."" "
Redirect,307,Temporary Redirect,RFC 7231,HTTP_STATUS_REDIRECT_KEEP_VERB // HTTP/1.1: keep same verb
Redirect,308,Permanent Redirect,RFC 7538,"The request, and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviours of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly."
Redirect,308,Resume Incomplete,Google,This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests
Client Error,400,Bad Request,RFC 7231,The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
Client Error,401,Unauthorized,RFC 2616,The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.46) containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the request already included Authorization credentials then the 401 response indicates that authorization has been refused for those credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the prior response and the user agent has already attempted authentication at least once then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was given in the response since that entity MAY include relevant diagnostic information. HTTP access authentication is explained in section 11.  IIS defines a number of different 401 errors that indicate a more specific cause of the error. These specific error codes are displayed in the browser but are not displayed in the IIS log.
Client Error,401.1,Access denied.,Microsoft,Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials.
Client Error,401.2,Access denied.,Microsoft,Unauthorized: Access is denied due to server configuration favoring an alternate authentication method.
Client Error,401.3,Access denied.,Microsoft,Unauthorized: Access is denied due to an ACL set on the requested resource. This indicates a problem with NTFS permissions. This error may occur even if the permissions are correct for the file that you are trying to access. For example you see this error if the IUSR account does not have access to the C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv directory. For additional information about how to resolve this problem click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: 187506 INFO: Basic NTFS permissions for IIS 4.0

Client Error,402,Payment Required,RFC 7231,This code is reserved for future use.
Client Error,403,Forbidden,RFC 7231,The server understood the request but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. If the request method was not HEAD and the server wishes to make public why the request has not been fulfilled it SHOULD describe the reason for the refusal in the entity. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused or when no other response is applicable. IIS defines a number of different 403 errors that indicate a more specific cause of the error.
Client Error,403.1,Forbidden,Microsoft,Execute access forbidden. The following are two common causes of this error message: (1)You do not have enough Execute permissions. For example you may receive this error message if you try to access an ASP page in a directory where permissions are set to None or you try to execute a CGI script in a directory with Scripts Only permissions. To modify the Execute permissions click Properties click the Directory tab and make sure that the Execute Permissions setting is appropriate for the content that you are trying to access. (2) The script mapping for the file type that you are trying to execute is not set up to recognize the verb that you are using (for example GET or POST). To verify this right-click the directory in the MMC click Properties click the Directory tab click Configuration and verify that the script mapping for the appropriate file type is set up to allow the verb that you are using.

Client Error,418,I'm a teapot (RFC 2324),RFC 2324,This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes in RFC 2324 Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by tea pots requested to brew coffee.[54] This HTTP status is used as an easter egg in some websites including Google.com.[55]
Client Error,419,Authentication Timeout,Non-Standard,Not a part of the HTTP standard RFC 2616 - denotes that previously valid authentication has expired. It is used as an alternative to 401 Unauthorized in order to differentiate from otherwise authenticated clients being denied access to specific server resources.[citation needed][56]

Server Error,500.18,Internal Server Error,Microsoft,URL authorization store cannot be opened. This error code is specific to IIS 6.0.
Server Error,501,Not Implemented,RFC 7231,The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
Server Error,502,Bad Gateway,RFC 7231,The server while acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
Server Error,502,Bad gateway,,Bad gateway. You receive this error message when you try to run a CGI script that does not return a valid set of HTTP headers.
Server Error,502.1,Bad gateway,Microsoft,CGI application timeout.
Server Error,502.2,Bad gateway,Microsoft,Error in CGI application.
Server Error,503,Service Unavailable,RFC 7231,The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known the length of the delay may be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response. Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server must use it when becoming overloaded. Some servers may wish to simply refuse the connection.
Server Error,504,Gateway Timeout,RFC 7231,The server while acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a timely response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to complete the request.
Server Error,505,HTTP Version Not Supported,RFC 7231,The server does not support or refuses to support the HTTP protocol version that was used in the request message. The server is indicating that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same major version as the client as described in section 3.1 other than with this error message. The response SHOULD contain an entity describing why that version is not supported and what other protocols are supported by that server.
Server Error,506,Variant also negotiates.  Not an endpoint,RFC 2295,The 506 status code indicates that the server has an internal configuration error: the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself and is therefore not a proper end point in the negotiation process.
Server Error,507,Insufficient Storage,RFC 4918,The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request. This condition is considered to be temporary. If the request which received this status code was the result of a user action the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user action.
Server Error,508,Loop Detected,RFC 5842 WebDAV,The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request (sent in lieu of 208 Already Reported).
Server Error,508,Cross Server Binding Forbidden,,Cross Server Binding Forbidden - Since most servers will be forced to fail cross-server BIND requests because they are unable to guarantee the integrity of cross-server bindings status code 508 (Cross-server Binding Forbidden) is defined.
Server Error,509,Bandwidth Exceeded,Implementation Specific,Bandwidth Exceeded - Implementation dependent. (Apache bw/limited extension) The bandwidth available with your ISP or circuit provider has been/or soon will be exceeded. Different thresholds are used. 80 - 90% is common.
